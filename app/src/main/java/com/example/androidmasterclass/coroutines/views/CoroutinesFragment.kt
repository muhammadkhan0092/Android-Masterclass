        Coroutines work well with suspend functions.
        When a coroutine calls a suspend function and reaches a suspension point (e.g., delay, network call),
        the thread is released and can run other coroutines until they also reach a suspension point.
        When the first coroutineâ€™s suspension is over, it resumes execution on an available thread (not necessarily the same one).
        This allows coroutines to cooperate, ensuring that threads are not left idle while waiting.
        The logs below illustrate how these coroutines interleave and work together.
